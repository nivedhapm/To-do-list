# Project: Task Manager

## Description
This **To-Do List** is a Python-based console application that helps users manage their tasks effectively. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as done, view all tasks, and exit the program. It's a great project to practice core Python concepts like loops, functions, and conditional statements.

## Features
- **Add Task:** Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **View Tasks:** Display all tasks along with their statuses (Done/Not Done).
- **Mark Task as Done:** Mark any task as completed.
- **Exit:** Exit the application when you're done managing your tasks.
  
## Pre-requisites
1. **Basic Python Knowledge:** Familiarity with Python concepts like variables, loops, functions, and if statements.
2. **Python Installed:** Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. **Text Editor or IDE:** You'll need a code editor to write and run the code. Popular options include [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or a simple editor like Notepad.

## Python Concepts Needed
- **Conditional Statements**  
- **Looping**  
- **Functions:** You’ll use functions to manage your code better.
